### In the All In One repository change these settings:

Change these settings in the **_.env_** file:

```bash copy filename=".env"
UseTESK = true
```

In the **_docker-compose.yml_** set:

```yaml copy filename="docker-compose.yml"
// Set all instances of DemoMode and KeycloakDemoMode in the file to:
DemoMode = false
KeyCloakDemoMode = true

// Set TESKAPIURL to the URL where Funnel is hosted:
TESKAPIURL = "http://localhost:8000/v1/tasks"

// Set the prefix for GenericS3 storage:
TESKOutputBucketPrefix = "s3://" 
```
</Steps>

### Submit a TES message

Once the Funnel is running and the All In One is up and configured, you can submit a TES payload to the Submission Layer.

#### Get Access Token

From the Submission Layer navigate to **_API Access Token -> Copy to Clipboard_**

#### Authorise request

You can make the request from the swagger API hosted at `http://localhost:5034/swagger`.
Authorise the request with the Token from the **_Authorise_** button on the top right.

#### Make submission

More information on the TES payload can be found at the TES API [specification](https://ga4gh.github.io/task-execution-schemas/docs/#tag/TaskService/operation/CreateTask) website.

```bash copy

POST localhost:5034/v1/tasks
