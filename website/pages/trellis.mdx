# Trellis

**Trellis** is a framework for defining, governing, and deploying the components needed to support secure federation across Trusted Research Environments (TREs).

The framework provides a structured model for describing interfaces, dependencies, lifecycle, and operational considerations.
Through the concept of **Weaves**, Trellis enables deployable configurations of software, governance, and metadata across its **Planes**,
supporting repeatable, standards-based federation deployments for consortia and collaborative projects.

## Planes

A **Plane** is a logical layer of functions and responsibilities within a federated TRE, grouping related capabilities so they can be described and secured consistently.

The five Planes are:

- Analysis: Where queries and analyses are initiated.
- Control: Orchestration of queries, validation, and permissions.
- Management: Infrastructure creation, configuration, and monitoring.
- Data: Processing and computation; where analyses run.
- Security: Ingress and egress control.

## Weaves

A **Weave** is a deployable configuration that combines the software, configuration, governance, and metadata required for one or more Planes.

By referencing Helm charts, configuration files, and operational metadata, a Weave enables reproducible deployment of federation capabilities.
Weaves are used to operationalise Trellis, such as when a TRE consortium is formed and needs a consistent, standards-aligned deployment.

Different Weaves provide different capability and software across a federated TRE.

An example of a Weave in development is [Five Safes TES](/five_safes_tes).
