# Trellis

Trellis is a framework for defining, governing, and deploying the components needed to support secure federation across Trusted Research Environments (TREs).
- Captures the governance, networking, metadata, and relationships needed for cross-TRE collaboration.
- Organises federated capabilities into clearly defined Planes for consistent description, security, and governance.
- Provides a structured model for describing interfaces, dependencies, lifecycle, and operational considerations.
- Uses Weaves to define deployable configurations of software and metadata across Planes.
- Supports repeatable, standards-based federation deployments for consortia and collaborative projects.

## Planes

In Trellis, a Plane is a logical layer of functions and responsibilities within a federated TRE, grouping related capabilities so they can be described and secured consistently. The five Trellis Planes are:

- Analysis: Where queries and analyses are initiated.
- Control: Orchestration of queries, validation, and permissions.
- Management: Infrastructure creation, configuration, and monitoring.
- Data: Processing and computation; where analyses run.
- Security: Ingress and egress control.

## Weaves

A Weave is a deployable configuration that combines the software, configuration, governance, and metadata required for one or more Planes. Each Weave can reference Helm charts, configuration files, and operational metadata, enabling reproducible deployment of federation capabilities. Weaves are used to operationalise Trellis in real-world settings, such as when a consortium is formed and needs a consistent, standards-aligned deployment.
