# Trellis

**Trellis** is a framework for defining, governing, and deploying the components needed to support secure federation across Trusted Research Environments (TREs).

The framework provides a structured model for describing interfaces, dependencies, lifecycle, and operational considerations.
Through the concept of **Weaves**, Trellis enables deployable configurations of software, governance, and metadata across its zones,
supporting repeatable, standards-based federation deployments for consortia and collaborative projects.

## Weaves

A **Weave** is a deployable configuration that combines the description of software capability, governance, configuration, and metadata required for a model of federation.

By referencing configuration, and metadata, a Weave implementation enables reproducible deployment of federation capabilities.
Weaves are used to operationalise Trellis, such as when a TRE consortium is formed and needs a consistent, standards-aligned deployment.

Different Weaves provide different capability across a federated TRE, and is not software specific. 

An example of a Weave in development is [Five Safes TES](/five_safes_tes).
