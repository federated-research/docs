# Federated Research Patterns

    These concepts are still emerging, so get [in touch](mailto:healthinformatics@nottingham.ac.uk) if you have feedback.

Across research data infrastructure there is no shared understanding on what is achievable and required to enable sustainable federation. Beyond a definition, there is a gap in translating the technologically possible and what is operationally necessary.

To address these challenges, the Federated Research Patterns framework was created to:
- consistently describe paths towards different models of federation
- define what is required to operationalise federation for TREs
- acknowledge the limitations of models of federation

The key to the framework is the representation of needs of stakeholders involved in deploying and using federated research data infrastructe:
- **Researchers**: What analysis is possible?
- **Data organisations**: Does the solution adhere to organisation policy and procedures?
- **TREs**: What controls are there over the data? 
- **Information Governance**: Does is adhere to data standards and best-practice?
