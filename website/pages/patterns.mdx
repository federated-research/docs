# Federated Research Patterns

<Callout type="default">
    These concepts are still emerging, so get [in touch](https://federated-analytics.ac.uk/federated-analytics/community/) if you have feedback.
</Callout>

**Federated Research Patterns** is a framework defining considerations required to support secure federation across Trusted Research Environments (TREs). Currently, the framework is defined as:
- Services
- Analytical patterns
- Movement
- Data egress
- Metadata requirements
- Governance

By addressing the technical and non-technical requirements, **Patterns** enables configurations of software, governance, and metadata, supporting repeatable, standards-based federation for consortia and collaborative projects.

## Weaves

A **Weave** is a configuration that combines the description of software capability, governance, configuration, and metadata required for a model of federation.

A Weave implementation enables a consistent description of federation capabilities.
Weaves are used to implement a Pattern, such as when a TRE consortium is formed and needs a consistent, standards-aligned description of a model of federation.

Different Weaves provide different capability across a federated TRE, and is not software specific. 

An example of a Weave in development is [Five Safes TES](/five_safes_tes).
