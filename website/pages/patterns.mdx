# Federated Research Patterns

    These concepts are still emerging, so get [in touch](https://federated-analytics.ac.uk/federated-analytics/community/) if you have feedback.

**Federated Research Patterns** is a framework for defining and governing the components needed to support secure federation across Trusted Research Environments (TREs).

Through the concept of **Weaves**, Patterns enables configurations of software, governance, and metadata,
supporting repeatable, standards-based federation for consortia and collaborative projects.

## Weaves

A **Weave** is a configuration that combines the description of software capability, governance, configuration, and metadata required for a model of federation.

A Weave implementation enables a consistent description of federation capabilities.
Weaves are used to implement a Pattern, such as when a TRE consortium is formed and needs a consistent, standards-aligned description of a model of federation.

Different Weaves provide different capability across a federated TRE, and is not software specific. 

An example of a Weave in development is [Five Safes TES](/five_safes_tes).
