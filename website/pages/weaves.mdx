# Weaves

A **Weave** is a configuration that combines the description of software capability, governance, and metadata required for a model of federation.

A Weave implementation enables a consistent description of federation capabilities.
Weaves are used to implement a Pattern, such as when a TRE consortium is formed and needs a consistent, standards-aligned description of a model of federation.

Different Weaves provide different capability across a federated TRE, and is not software specific. 

An example of a Weave in development is [Five Safes TES](/five_safes_tes).
