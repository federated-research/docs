# Adding a researcher to the platform

To fully add a researcher to the platform
they need to both be given an account to the Keycloak user management system,
and to be added to the people records in the submission layer.
Their records across these are implicitly associated by their `username`.

## Prerequisites

Required information:
- First Name
- Last Name
- Email address

## Process


<Steps>
### Researcher requests account on platform.

The researcher fills out a request form for an account on the service.

</Callout>

### Request is approved.

The request is approved.
**At this point a `username` should be defined for the researcher**.

that might be required for accessing the submission layer.
