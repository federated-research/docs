# TRE Agent

The TRE Agent handles the communication between the [Submission Layer](/software/submission) and a Trusted Research Environment.
The TRE Agent polls out to the Submission Layer, gets a task, then sends the task to an implementation of the [GA4GH Task Execution Service](/standards/#task-execution-service-tes).
Once the task is finished executing the TRE Agent sends the results to [Egress](/software/egress).

The code for TRE Agent is open source, and can be found on [Github](https://github.com/SwanseaUniversityMedical/DARE-Control).

## Core Functionality

- Polls the Submission Layer to retrieve new tasks
- Submits tasks to a GA4GH TES implementation
- Monitors task execution and collects results
- Sends task outputs to the Egress service for approval
- Maintains communication flow between the Submission Layer, TES, and Egress

## Use in Federated Research

TRE Agent is used within the [Five Safes TES](/five_safes_tes) weave, and is situated within the [Control Plane](/trellis/planes/control).

## Integration and Extensibility

TRE Agent provides a API that can be used to integrate and build against.

## Ideal Uses Cases

- Orchestrating task execution inside a TRE
- Connecting submission workflows to TES backends
- Enabling controlled communication between TRE components
- Supporting federated task execution across TREs
