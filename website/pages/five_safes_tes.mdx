# Five Safes TES

## Core Functionality

**Five Safes TES** is a Weave for the secure, remote execution of [GA4GH TES analyses](/standards#global-alliance-for-genomics-and-health-ga4gh) in Trusted Research Environments (TREs).

- Researchers can submit GA4GH TES analyses for secure execution within participating TREs.

Built on international [open standards](/standards) from GA4GH and ELIXIR, **Five Safes TES** uses an enhanced GA4GH Task Execution Service
to receive federated analysis requests. This approach supports the essential disclosure control processes within TREs, ensuring outputs are reviewed
to prevent disclosive data from leaving secure environments.

## Use in Federated Research

Five Safes TES enables secure cross-TRE federated analytics, where the data remains in place and only the researchers’
analysis code is sent to the data. It is specifically designed to meet the stringent technical and governance constraints
of TREs by separating the logical stages of a federated project.
