# Approving Project Access to TRE

## Process

The TRE Agent will sync any Projects created in the submission layer every 10 minutes by default.
To adjust how long between each sync change the `syncSchedule` [setting](/tre_agent/deploy#configure-the-env-file).

<Steps>
### Login
Log in to the TRE Agent UI.

- If you are using the AllInOne stack, the TRE Agent UI is available at `http://localhost:8989/` with the username `globaladminuser` and password `password123`.
- If you are using a regular deployment, the TRE Agent UI is available at the port `8989` of the host machine of `TRE`.
  To access the TRE Agent UI, you need to create a new TRE admin user in the `Dare-TRE` Keycloak realm, with the `dare-tre-admin` role and joined the `dare-tre-admin` group.

### Find Project

Once the TRE Agent is in sync, the Project will appear in the TRE Agent UI.
