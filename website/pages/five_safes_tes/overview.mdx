# Overview of 5 Safes TES

### Architecture : Five Safes TES

The 5 Safes TES (Task Execution Service) is designed to handle sensitive data analysis within a secure and controlled environment. The architecture followed by a Fan-out pattern for the implementation and is organized into multiple layers and application components.

Aggregation is supported via external tools and after 5S-TES completes analysis tasks, users can run a dedicated aggregation tool to collect and summarise results. Check [Run an Analysis section](https://docs.federated-analytics.ac.uk/submission/tasks/run_analysis) for an example aggregation.

The 5 Safes TES is divided into multiple layers of process and multiple app stack as discussed below.

**The layers of the architecture are:**

- **Submission Layer**: Entrypoint for user requests, authentication, and authorisation.
- **Storage Layer (User)**: Centralized storage for user inputs, metadata and artefacts.
- **TRE Layer**: Core processing layer for data analysis.
- **Storage Layer (Collection of Results)**: Secure storage for storing analysis results for the data owner.

**The Five Safes TES app stack includes:**

- **Submission App:** Handles user submissions.
- **TRE Agent App:** Manages task execution within the TRE for data analytics.
- **Egress App:** Controls the release of results to users

### Operational Overview: Five Safes TES

The high level overview of working of the Five Safes TES is as follows:


<u style={{ display: 'block', marginTop: '20px' }}>
  <strong>Submission App</strong>
</u>
<div>

  1. The process begins with the end user or researcher submitting a request for the desired analysis through the Trusted Research Environments. Then, authentication and authorisation checks are performed to ensure the user is assigned to the relevant project.

  2. Once the request (contains the code for analysis, metadata information) is accepted by the TRE Agent, it then processes the request and saves the outputs in centralized storage at the user level.

  3. The request is then placed in a queue as a task for the corresponding nodes in the federated network, and the user is notified that their request has been accepted.

<u style={{ display: 'block', marginTop: '20px' }}>
  <strong>TRE Agent App</strong>
</u>
<div>
    1. The TRE Agent in the TRE Layer monitors the queue for new jobs (tasks). Once identified, the task are taken from the queue and sent to the for authorisation by TREs.

    2. Then, a tool is called Camunda is used to dynamically inject the database connection string and credentials into the Funnel container to connect the database.

    3. Then the payload is send to the Task Execution Service API(TES API) which receives code & message and translates them into the unified, platform-independent format.

    4. All together, the standardised payload is sent by the TES API to a Docker image which executes the analysis query on the database with the respected database crentials managed by camunda.

    5. The results of this analysis are then saved in storage at the TRE Agent Owner Level.

<u style={{ display: 'block', marginTop: '20px' }}>
  <strong>Egress App</strong>
</u>
<div>
    1. After the analysis results are stored, the TRE notifies the data owner (a designated human reviewer) to approve the release of results.
    
    2. The owner can now reviews the output and, if approved, authorises the egress.
    
    3. Upon approval, the results are retrieved from storage and sent back through the submission layer and finally, the end user or researcher receives their requested analysis results.
