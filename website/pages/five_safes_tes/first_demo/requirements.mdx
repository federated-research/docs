and you will need to install this in order to use this service.

The configuration script is shared via [GitHub](https://www.github.com).
You do not need a GitHub account to access these,
but you may wish to create one in order to keep your configuration script in version control.
If you do this you will also need Git installed on your machine.

## Pre-Reading

The instructions below for starting the service are reasonably well contained,
but we will not explain in detail here what the specific docker or git commands do.
For your reference we include here links to introductionary training courses on Docker and Git.
