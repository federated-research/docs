## In the All In One repository change these settings:

Change these settings in the **_.env_** file:

```bash copy filename=".env"
UseTESK = true
```

In the **_docker-compose.yml_** set:

```yaml copy filename="docker-compose.yml"
// Set all instances of DemoMode and KeycloakDemoMode in the file to:
DemoMode = false
KeyCloakDemoMode = true

// Set TESKAPIURL to the URL where Funnel is hosted:
TESKAPIURL = "http://localhost:8000/v1/tasks"

// Set the prefix for GenericS3 storage:
TESKOutputBucketPrefix = "s3://" 
```
</Steps>

## Submit a TES message

Once the Funnel is running and the All In One is up and configured, you can submit a TES payload to the Submission Layer.
