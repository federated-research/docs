### Install Funnel

<Cards>

<Cards.Card 

title="How to install Funnel"
  href='/five_safes_tes/deploy/install_funnel'
  arrow
 
/>

</Cards>
### In the All In One repository change these settings:

Change these settings in the **_.env_** file:

```bash copy filename=".env"
UseTESK = true
```

In the **_docker-compose.yml_** set:

```yaml copy filename="docker-compose.yml"
// Set all instances of DemoMode and KeycloakDemoMode in the file to:
DemoMode = false
KeyCloakDemoMode = true

// Set TESKAPIURL to the URL where Funnel is hosted:
TESKAPIURL = "http://localhost:8000/v1/tasks"

// Set the prefix for GenericS3 storage:
TESKOutputBucketPrefix = "s3://" 
```
</Steps>

### Submit a TES message

Once the Funnel is running and the All In One is up and configured, you can submit a TES payload to the Submission Layer.

#### Get Access Token

From the Submission Layer navigate to **_API Access Token -> Copy to Clipboard_**

#### Authorise request

You can make the request from the swagger API hosted at `http://localhost:5034/swagger`.
Authorise the request with the Token from the **_Authorise_** button on the top right.

#### Make submission

More information on the TES payload can be found at the TES API [specification](https://ga4gh.github.io/task-execution-schemas/docs/#tag/TaskService/operation/CreateTask) website.

#### Get Project Output Bucket
The output bucket for a project can be found in the Submission UI. 
Go to `Project` -> `About` page and hover over `Output Bucket`.
The naming pattern is: ` <projectName> + <projectUniqueID> + output`.
Then add `tre` to the end of it.
For example the submission output bucket is: `demoproject2367output` then you need to set it to: `demoproject2367outputtre` 


```bash copy

POST localhost:5034/v1/tasks
{
    "state": 0,
    "name": "Hello World",
    "inputs": [],
    "outputs": [
        {
            "name": "Stdout",
            "description": "Stdout results",
            "url": "s3://<outputBucketName>", // Set the output bucket
            "path": "/outputs",
            "type": "DIRECTORY"
        }
    ],
    "executors": [
        {
            "image": "ubuntu",
            "command": [
                "echo",
                "Hello World"
            ],
            "workdir": "/outputs",
            "stdout": "/outputs/stdout",
        }
    ],
    "volumes": null,
    "tags": {
        "project": "<ProjectName>", // Project that you would like to submit to.
        "tres": "<TREName>" // TRE related to that Project
    },
    "logs": null,
    "creation_time": null
}

```
