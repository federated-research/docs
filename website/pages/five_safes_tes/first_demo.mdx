# All In One Stack

This is a demonstration instance of the complete stack, intended to be run locally.

The purpose of this is to allow you to install a version of all the components in a single install for you to explore how this stack can be useful for you
or as part of a development pathway.

<Callout type="warning">
This is not intended to be a production deployment.
</Callout>

To run this you will need [Docker](https://www.docker.com/),
which can be installed following these [instructions](https://uomresearchit.github.io/docker-introduction/index.html#installation-of-docker).
Any issues can be raised [here](https://github.com/federated-research/docs/issues).
