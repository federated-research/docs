## Troubleshooting

### 1. [Keycloak console](http://localhost:8085) requires HTTPS

If you encounter issues where the Keycloak console requires HTTPS, you can resolve this by accessing the Docker container directly:

1. Access the Docker exec of Keycloak container:

```bash
docker exec -it <keycloak-container-name> bash
```

2. Navigate to the Keycloak bin directory and configure the realm:

```bash
cd /opt/keycloak/bin
./kcadm.sh config credentials --server http://localhost:8080 --realm master --user admin
./kcadm.sh update realms/master -s sslRequired=NONE
```

3. Enter `admin` for the password when prompted.

### 2. `KeyCloakDemoMode = true` in `.env` but KeyCloak still requires HTTPS

If you have set `KeyCloakDemoMode = true` in your `.env` file but KeyCloak still requires HTTPS when logging in locally into the Submission layer, for example, follow these steps:

1. Access the Keycloak console at `http://localhost:8085`, using the admin credentials:

```yaml copy
Username: admin
Password: admin
```

2. Navigate to each Realm: `DARE-Control`, `DARE-TRE`, `DARE-Egress` by clicking on the Realm name in the left-hand side.
3. Access `Realm settings` under `Configure` section on the left-hand side menu.
4. Choose `None` from the `Require SSL` dropdown.
5. Click on the `Save` button.

### 3. Docker can't access the file directory to mount the `init.sql` file

If you encounter issues where Docker can't access the file directory to mount the `init.sql` file, you can resolve this by adding the directory path to the shared paths from `Docker -> Preferences -> Resources -> File Sharing`.
