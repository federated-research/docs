# Egress

The Egress application handles data egress requests. Once a task is finished executing, the results are submitted to it for approval where a Trusted Research Environment (TRE) administrator can check them. Once results are approved or rejected, Egress then sends an update to the [TRE Agent](/software/agent) API.

The code for Egress is open source, and can be found on [Github](https://github.com/SwanseaUniversityMedical/DARE-Control).

## Core Functionality

- Accepts submitted results from completed TRE tasks for review
- Provides an approval and rejection workflow for TRE administrators
- Tracks the status of egress requests and their outcomes
- Notifies the TRE Agent when results are approved or rejected
- Maintains an auditable record of egress decisions

## Use in Federated Research

Egress is used within the [Five Safes TES](/five_safes_tes) weave, and is situated within the [Security Plane](/trellis/planes/security).

## Integration and Extensibility

Egress provides a API that can be used to integrate and build against. 

## Ideal Uses Cases

- Provide egress checking functionality to a Trusted Research Environment
