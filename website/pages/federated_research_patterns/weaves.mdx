# Developing a Weave

A **Weave** is a instantiation of Patterns that enables a consistent description of the capabilities for an approach to federation.

A Weave describes the Patterns to provide reproducible federated capability. Different Weaves define a different capability across a federated TRE, and is not software specific.

## Weave Identity

A weave must contain:
-	One Analytical Pattern
- 	One Data Movement Pattern
- 	One Initiate Pattern
- 	One Process Pattern
- 	One or more Egress Pattern
- 	None to Many Metadata Pattern
- 	An open source reference implementation

Given a Weave can only contain a single analytical, data, initiate and process Pattern it is therefore the case that if any of those change it is required to create a new Weave.
