# Developing a Weave

A **Weave** is a configuration of Patterns that enables a consistent description of the capabilities for a model of federation. 

A Weave describes the Patterns to provide reproducible federated capability, that is consistent, standards-aligned description of a model of federation. Different Weaves define a different capability across a federated TRE, and is not software specific.
