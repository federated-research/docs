<Callout type="default">
    These concepts are still emerging, so get [in touch](https://federated-analytics.ac.uk/federated-analytics/community/) if you have feedback.

**Federated Research Patterns** is a framework defining dimensions required to support secure federation across Trusted Research Environments (TREs). The framework is defined by:
- A set of Functional patterns
- A set of Analytical patterns
- A set of Data Movement patterns
- A set of Data Egress patterns
- A set of Metadata patterns!

By understanding the technical and non-technical requirements, **Patterns** enable configurations of software, governance, and metadata, supporting repeatable, standards-based federation for consortia and collaborative projects.
