# Patterns framework

The **Patterns Framework** defines the dimensions required to support secure federation across Trusted Research Environments (TREs). By understanding the requirements, the configuration of the **Patterns** supports sustainable, repeatable, and standards-based federation.

| Pattern dimensions    | Description                                                                                | Component                                       |
|-----------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------|
| **Analytical**        | Understanding the analytics required for the research informs the statistics and determines the algorithm type. Where the algorithm type categorises what analyses could be supported. | Decomposable, Iterative, Data Pooling           |
| **Data Movement**     | As deteremined by the algorithm type, this is how data is required to moves in and out of a TRE and how it is exectued.  | Summary, Model Weights, Row level data    |
| **Data Egress**       | The output checking method required for the egress of results                              | Off, Manual, Semi-automated, Automated          |
| **Metadata**          | Information that is descriptive for reproducability and/ or attributes provenance that accompanies the analyses or results. |                                                 |
| **Functional**        | The components that are functionally required to enable federation.                        | Initiate, Input, Process, Output                |

## Framework components

### Analytical

- Decomposable: An algorithm in which the final result can be exactly reconstructed from local results computed on separate subsets of data in one round of aggregation.
- Iterative: A federated algorithm which required multiple rounds of local calculation and aggregation.
- Data Pooling: An algorithm which cannot be separated or calculated iteratively. These are only possible by pooling data.

### Data Movement
