# TRE Agent

The TRE Agent handles the communication between the Submission Layer and the TRE. The TRE Agent polls out to the Submission Layer, gets a task, then sends the task to an implementation of the GA4GH Task Execution Schemas (TESK or Funnel). Once the task is finished executing the TRE Agent sends the results to Egress.

The code for TRE Agent is open source, and can be found on [Github](https://github.com/SwanseaUniversityMedical/DARE-Control).
