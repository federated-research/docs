# Submission Layer

This is the front page of the stack, which any researchers interacting with the service will use. Approved researchers can submit tasks to a Project using the API or by interacting with the UI.

The code for Submission is open source, and can be found on [Github](https://github.com/SwanseaUniversityMedical/DARE-Control).
