# Submission Layer

This is the entry point for a researcher. Approved researchers can submit tasks to a Project using the API or by interacting with the application.

The code for Submission is open source, and can be found on [Github](https://github.com/SwanseaUniversityMedical/DARE-Control).

## Core Functionality

- Provides an API and user interface for researchers to submit tasks
- Authenticates and authorises approved researchers
- Forwards validated tasks to the Trusted Research Environment agent for execution
- Tracks the status of submitted tasks

## Use in Federated Research

Submission Layer is used within the [Five Safes TES](/five_safes_tes) weave.

## Integration and Extensibility

Submission Layer provides a API that can be used to integrate and build against. 

## Ideal Uses Cases

- Entry point for researchers into a federated TRE system
- Submitting and monitoring analysis tasks
- Integrating external tools with the TRE task workflow
