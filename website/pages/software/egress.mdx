# Egress

The Egress API handles egress requests. Once a task is finished executing the results are then waiting for approval in the Egress layer. Once results are approved/rejected it sends an update to the TRE Agent.

The code for Egress is open source, and can be found on [Github](https://github.com/SwanseaUniversityMedical/DARE-Control).
