### Ideal Use Cases

Relay is open-source, containerised, and security-conscious—enabling ethical, scalable health research through federated collaboration.

- Multi-site cohort discovery for clinical trials or observational studies
- Feasibility assessments without sharing raw data
- Privacy-preserving network coordination with built-in resilience to node outages

[Relay](https://hutch.health/relay) is an application developed by the University of Nottingham that enables **federated cohort discovery** across health data networks.

The code for Relay is open source, and can be found on [Github](https://github.com/Health-Informatics-UoN/hutch-relay).

More about Relay and how to deploy it can be found in the [Relay documentation](https://hutch.health/relay).

### Integration and Extensibility

Relay integrates seamlessly with the Task API, allowing coordinated queries across multiple nodes. Its open-source nature means it can be extended, adapted, and embedded into existing research infrastructures to support a range of governance and interoperability needs.
