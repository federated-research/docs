# Discovery

## Ideal Use Cases

Bunny is open-source, lightweight, and security-conscious, enabling ethical, scalable health research without compromising data control at the institutional level.

- **Cohort discovery** for clinical trials or observational studies
- **Feasibility assessments** before launching multi-center research

## Functionality
| Initiate | Input | Process | Output |
|----------|-------|---------|--------|
| RQuest | [Bunny](https://hutch.health/bunny)  | [Bunny](https://hutch.health/bunny) | [Bunny](https://hutch.health/bunny)|
