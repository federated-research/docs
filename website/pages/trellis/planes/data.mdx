# Data Plane

The **Data Plane** handles processing and computation within a federated Trusted Research Environment (TRE). 
This is where analyses run and where the actual data processing occurs, serving as the computational engine of the federated system.

## Overview

The Data Plane represents the computational core of the Trellis framework, responsible for executing analytical queries, processing data, and performing computations across federated data sources. 
It provides the computational resources and processing capabilities necessary to support complex analytical workloads while maintaining data privacy and security.

## Core Capabilities

### Data Processing
- **Query Execution**: Execution of analytical queries across federated data sources
- **Data Transformation**: Transformation and preprocessing of data for analysis
- **Data Aggregation**: Aggregation of data from multiple sources
- **Data Validation**: Validation of data quality and integrity

### Analytics Execution
- **Statistical Analysis**: Execution of statistical analyses and modeling
- **Machine Learning**: Training and evaluation of machine learning models
- **Visualisation**: Generation of data visualisations and reports

### Federation Support
- **Cross-site Computation**: Coordination of computations across multiple federated sites
- **Data Movement**: Secure movement of data between sites when necessary
- **Result Aggregation**: Aggregation of results from multiple sites
- **Privacy-preserving Computation**: Implementation of privacy-preserving computational techniques
