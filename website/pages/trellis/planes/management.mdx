# Management Plane

The **Management Plane** handles infrastructure creation, configuration, and monitoring within a federated Trusted Research Environment (TRE).
This Plane provides the operational foundation that enables all other planes to function effectively and efficiently.

## Overview

The Management Plane serves as the operational backbone of the Trellis framework, responsible for provisioning, configuring, monitoring, and maintaining the infrastructure components that support the entire federated system.
It ensures that the infrastructure is resilient, scalable, and compliant with operational requirements.
