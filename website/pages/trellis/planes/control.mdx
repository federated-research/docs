# Control Plane

The **Control Plane** orchestrates queries, validation, and permissions within a federated Trusted Research Environment (TRE).
This plane serves as the central coordination layer that manages the flow of queries and ensures proper governance across all other planes.

## Overview

The Control Plane acts as the "controller" of the Trellis framework, responsible for coordinating activities across all other planes, validating requests, managing permissions, and ensuring that all operations comply with governance policies and security requirements.
