# Security Plane

The **Security Plane** manages ingress and egress control within a federated Trusted Research Environment (TRE). 
This plane provides security controls and mechanisms to validate what analysis is allowed to run and what results can be returned to users.

## Overview

The Security Plane serves as the protective layer of the Trellis framework, responsible for validating analytical queries before execution and checking analysis results before they are returned to users. 
It ensures that only approved analyses are executed and that results comply with privacy, governance, and security requirements.

## Core Capabilities

- **Query Validation**: Validation of analytical queries against security policies
- **Algorithm Approval**: Verification that requested algorithms are approved for use
- **Data Access Validation**: Checking that queries only access permitted data sources
- **Privacy Budget Enforcement**: Ensuring queries respect privacy budget constraints

### Result Egress Control
- **Output Validation**: Validation and sanitisation of analysis results
- **Privacy Protection**: Protection of sensitive information in results
- **Statistical Disclosure Control**: Application of statistical disclosure control methods
- **Result Filtering**: Filtering of results that may reveal sensitive information

### Policy Enforcement
- **Security Policy Application**: Application of security policies to queries and results
