# Analysis Plane

The **Analysis Plane** is the logical layer where queries and analyses are initiated within a federated Trusted Research Environment (TRE). This plane serves as the primary interface for researchers and analysts to interact with the federated system.

## Overview

The Analysis Plane represents the user-facing layer of the Trellis framework, providing the tools, interfaces, and capabilities necessary for researchers to formulate, submit, and manage their analytical queries across federated data sources.

## Core Capabilities

### Query Initiation
- **Query Formulation**: Tools and interfaces for creating and structuring analytical queries
- **Query Validation**: Pre-submission validation of query syntax and semantics
- **Query Submission**: Submission of queries to the federated system

### User Interface
- **Web-based Interfaces**: Browser-accessible tools for query creation and management
- **API Endpoints**: Programmatic interfaces for integration with external tools
- **Command-line Tools**: Terminal-based interfaces for advanced users
- **Notebook Integration**: Support for Jupyter notebooks and similar environments

### Query Types
- **Statistical Queries**: Descriptive statistics, hypothesis testing, and statistical modeling
- **Machine Learning**: Training and evaluation of ML models on federated data
- **Data Exploration**: Exploratory data analysis and visualisation queries
- **Custom Analytics**: User-defined analytical workflows and algorithms
