# Planes

A **Plane** is a logical layer of functions and responsibilities within a federated Trusted Research Environment, grouping related capabilities so they can be described and secured consistently.

The five Planes are:

- [Analysis](planes/analysis): Where queries and analyses are initiated.
- [Control](planes/control): Orchestration of queries, validation, and permissions.
- [Management](planes/management): Infrastructure creation, configuration, and monitoring.
- [Data](planes/data): Processing and computation; where analyses run.
- [Security](planes/security): Ingress and egress control.
