# Creating a Project

Adding a project to the TRE-FX platform involves two main steps.
First the Submission Layer Manager needs to create it in the TRE-FX submission layer.
Then the TRE Manager(s) whose TRE's the project will use need to approve access.

## Prerequisites

Required information:
- Project Name
- Start and End dates
- Project embargo status
- Researcher usernames to be associated with project

Optional (for this system) information:
- Project Owner, and contact
- Project Description

The TRE Manager(s) will need:
- Database Credentials
- Project access expiry date

## Process

<Steps>
### Researcher requests project is added to platform

The researcher fills out a request form to add a project,
specifying in this which TRE's they wish to use.

### [Add the project to Submission Layer](/activities/submissionManagerAddingNewProject)

The project is added to the Submission Layer by the Submission Layer Manager.
Researchers are added to the project at this point too.

### [Approve project access to TRE](/activities/TREManagerApprovingProject)

The TRE Manager reviews the access request to their TRE for the project,
and approve these as appropriate.
At this stage the TRE Manager will also approve any Researchers
who have been allocated to the project.
