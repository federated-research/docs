# Branding

We love seeing Federated Research being used in talks, proposals, and accreditations, so feel free to use our logos. 

The Federated Research logo is used as the base for logos of Weaves, therefore is extensible.

You'll find a selection to use below, please use the best one that is most visible, at a size that is best legible for your use.
