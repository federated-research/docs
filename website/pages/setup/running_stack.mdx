## Running All-In-One Stack

To start the service follow the steps below:

<Steps>
### Change to directory containing Docker Compose configuration file

Within the **DARE-TREFX-Environment1** directory the configuration files are in the
`AllInOne` directory:
```
cd AllInOne
```

### Start the Docker Service

In the same directory as the `docker-compose.yml` file run:
```bash copy
docker compose up -d
```
This will start the docker stack - you should see a list of services starting up.

### Checking Status of Docker Service

The status of the services can be checked using Docker Desktop,
or by running this command:
```bash copy
docker stats
```

### Stopping the Docker Service

Once you have finished using the service it can be stopped by
running this command in the same directory as the `docker-compose.yml` file:
```bash copy
docker compose down
```

## Troubleshooting

  <Tabs.Tab>
    <Callout> Docker may need access to the file directory to mount the `init.sql` file.
    Add the directory path to the shared paths from `Docker -> Preferences -> 
    Resources -> File Sharing` </Callout>
